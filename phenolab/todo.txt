(1) deployment from localhost -> snowflake
x definition_library needs to become part of phenolab
x fix dependencies
x fix connection to snowflake
x fix definition_library backend
x fix update.py. Is update.py the best way to do things? at least change the session management
x dependencies on streamlit is an issue...go to static downloads
x temp tables
x openpyxl
x check whether feature store manager still works after refactoring of connection
- >> need to add in NHS GP table and NEL segments <<
x maybe should/check fix 'uploaded datetime', especially for those where doing asynchronous upload
x fix the database/schema defaults because I think i did them wrong
x tidy up main page appearance
x update definition_library readme.md
x page to browse by source

(2a) CI approach
- github actions

(2b) ICB table with 'starterpack' model
- create ICB table
- definitions should go to ICB table
- UNLESS we create them as jsons/export as jsons
- existing NEL segments need to go in ICB table

(3) external definitions starterpack
x done 

(4) aesthetic changes

(5) general/misc
- redundant imports
- get rid of some of the database utils functions
- add some tests?

(5b) ICB-specific config
- check if config in PHMutils should be part of phenolab or more likely, switch to a config file
- see if the config is a good idea/should be refactored/homogenised with database/schema
- get rid of load_dotenv?

(6) delete definition option?

(7) phenotypes

(8) measurements

(9) vocab loading

(10) base features
- get rid of pipeline folder

(11) ugggh
- retrieving bnf definitions is very slow
