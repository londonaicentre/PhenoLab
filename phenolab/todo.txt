(1) deployment from localhost -> snowflake
x definition_library needs to become part of phenolab
x fix dependencies
x fix connection to snowflake
x fix definition_library backend
x fix update.py. Is update.py the best way to do things? at least change the session management
x dependencies on streamlit is an issue...go to static downloads
x temp tables
x openpyxl
x check whether feature store manager still works after refactoring of connection
- NHS GP table
- NEL segments -> their own table
x retrieving bnf definitions is very slow
x maybe should/check fix 'uploaded datetime', especially for those where doing asynchronous upload
x fix the database/schema defaults because I think i did them wrong
x tidy up main page appearance
x update definition_library readme.md
x page to browse by source

(2a) CI approach
- github actions
- dev and prod

(2b) ICB table with 'starterpack' model
x create ICB table
x definitions should go to ICB table
x UNLESS we create them as jsons/export as jsons
x debugging mode
x fix problem with new jsons
x 'Edit existing' needs to be either jsons or table according to whether local or remote
x fix bug when no definition is selected
x don't allow duplicate name uploads to ICB table/decide how to do versioning in case of edits
x need to change definition behaviour to have proper versioning or else can't do edits to table-stored definitions
x 'View & Upload' tab

(3) external definitions starterpack
x done 

(4) aesthetic changes
x colour scheme
- reduce labels/visual clutter
x rename definition panels

(5) general/misc
- redundant imports!
- get rid of some of the database utils functions
- add some tests?
x do I need to be calling (a) session and (b) config as function imports?? (No - session state seems to exist across 
imports too)

(5b) ICB-specific config
x check if config in PHMutils should be part of phenolab or more likely, switch to a config file
x see if the config is a good idea/should be refactored/homogenised with database/schema
x refactor
x get rid of load_dotenv?
x see if can use get_account() to select config file
x config for environmental variables
x local config
- environment.yml fix (could it be packaging as snowflake native app?)
- people should be using snowflake config rather than .env - replace examples
- explain all in readme

(5c) tidying
- finish converting away from Snowflake Connection & context manager to explicit management
- move all version control into definition.py class
x should probably extract all session fetching and just put it in session_state as part of the setup
x could make one function that did all the page setting up/checking the session_state e.g. for the configs

(5d) search definitions page
- page to search definition titles and then see codes within

(6) delete definition option
- add tab to page 2 to delete definition versions, both jsons and on database

(7) phenotypes
- how to turn into SQL? (or should we remove from interface)

(8) measurements
x fix load definition
x fix load definition in page 2
- *measurement config files -> remote version - how to?

(9) vocab loading
x push further down list

(10) base features
- *need to add definition version to base features?
- *is it one per person or all?
- need to sort out config thingy as have made config part of phenolab
- get rid of pipeline folder

(12) snowflake feature store/get rid of feature store altogether

(14) remote deployment
- need to push up again
