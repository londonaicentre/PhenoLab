## Remaining to do on the tables
- [x] Fix issue with .mg - will likely need regex for this
- [ ] Decide what to do about null values and confidence in them - probably just bin
- [ ] Make a GUI for doing the cleaning and converting - not imminently
- [ ] Also still to make system for comparing to distributions and choosing cutoffs programmatically
- [x] Make the json for units into a temporary table, can do this for conversions as well
- [ ] Have third column for unit lookup with definition and then join on both cols
