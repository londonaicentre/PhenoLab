## Remaining to do on the tables
- [ ] Fix issue with .mg - will likely need regex for this
- [ ] Decide what to do about null values and confidence in them
- [ ] Make a GUI for doing the cleaning and converting - not imminently
- [ ] Also still to make system for comparing to distributions and choosing cutoffs programmatically
- [ ] Make the json for units into a temporary table, can do this for conversions as well
