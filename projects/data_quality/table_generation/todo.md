## Remaining to do on the tables
- [x] Fix issue with .mg - will likely need regex for this
- [x] Make the json for units into a temporary table, can do this for conversions as well
- [x] Have third column for unit lookup with definition and then join on both cols
- [x] Sort orchestration so that this can all be run from one script
- [ ] Decide what to do about null values and confidence in them - probably just bin
- [ ] Also still to make system for comparing to distributions and choosing cutoffs programmatically
- [x] Write the user story for the app
- [x] Ongoing work on GUI - now on page 2
- [ ] Finish edit unit page of gui
- [ ] Add observations_clean as a feature
- [ ] Finish doing random blood sugar units (mmol/mol done, need to do mg/dl)
