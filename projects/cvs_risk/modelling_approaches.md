- Cox proportional hazards model - time to event analysis
    - e.g. QRisk 10 - https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2099
    - NB lifelines (python package for survival analysis) - v helpful documentation - https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/
    - NB DeepSurv - deep learning approach to Survival analysis/Cox proportional hazards - don't need to specify the covariates; these are learnt - [code](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv), [paper](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1)
- Logistic regression
- Random forest/XGboost
- Transformer approach: ETHOS: Zero Shot Health Trajectory Prediction Using Transforme

Problems to think about:
- Class imbalance
- How to look for patients where intervention is lacking?
- Evaluation metric
